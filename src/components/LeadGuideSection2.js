        <br /> Before you start generating leads for your local service
        business, it is essential to define your target audience. Understanding
        your target audience helps you create a more focused marketing strategy
        that is more likely to attract potential customers. To define your
        target audience, consider the following questions: Who is your ideal
        customer? What are their needs and pain points? Where are they located?
        What are their demographics (age, gender, income, etc.)? What are their
        interests and behaviors? What are their buying habits? What are their
        preferred communication channels? Once you have defined your target
        audience, you can tailor your marketing efforts to meet their needs and
        preferences. This can help you generate more leads and convert them into
